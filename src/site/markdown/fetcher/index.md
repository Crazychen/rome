# Rome Fetcher

 

The Rome Fetcher (see modules/fetcher) allows the retrieval of feeds via HTTP. It supports [HTTP conditional gets](http://fishbowl.pastiche.org/2002/10/21/http_conditional_get_for_rss_hackers) (ie: last modified and ETag handling) and GZip encoded feeds. It should enable user to write aggregators that follow the [Atom aggregator behaviour recommendations](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/21/atom_aggregator_behavior_http_level)

 

As with the rest of Rome, the Fetcher subproject is ultra\-lean \- it requires [no new dependencies](Dependencies/index.html) over the requirements for Rome.
