### What is New / Highlights



Normally each release of ROME includes a whole new set of Wiki pages with the corresponding version number. ROME 1.0 is reusing wikis from previous versions as there are not significant changes. 


 
* ROME can now optionally preserve WireFeed (ie, Atom/RSS specific) data and make it available via the SyndFeed data model. See [PreservingWireFeeds](../PreservingWireFeeds.html) for further details
