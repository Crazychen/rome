# Rss and atOM utilitiEs (ROME) v0.5 and above Tutorials and Articles

## Tutorials



The following tutorials show how to use the ROME API. They focus on the higher abstraction layer of classes offered by ROME, what we call the Synd\* classes. By using the Synd\* classes developers don't have to deal with the specifics of any syndication feed. They work with normalized feeds, the Synd\* feeds. This makes it much easier to write applications that have to deal with all the variety of syndication feed types in use today.
