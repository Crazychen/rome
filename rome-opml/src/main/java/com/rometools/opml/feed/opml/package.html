    This package represents the base objects for OPML support for ROME.
    <p>
        There are three classes here that are relevant. <code>Opml</code>,
        which represents the root document and <code>head</code> information,
        <code>Outline</code> which represents a single node on an Opml 
        outline tree, and provides convenience methods for commonly used
        attributes such as <code>xmlUrl</code>. Finally, the 
        <code>Attribute</code> class, which represents a specific attribute
        on an Outline object. Since OPML supports free-form attribute
        assignments, this is a very multi-purpose class.
    </p>
    <p>Sample Usage:
        To use this parser, simply include the jar file in your classpath
        as you are using ROME. Be sure it exists at the same level as ROME,
        such that, if ROME is in the common classpath of an application server,
        don't include this jar in your webapps WEB-INF/lib.
        <code><pre>
  WireFeedInput input = new WireFeedInput();
  Opml feed = (Opml) input.build( new File("myOpml.xml") );
  List&lt;Outline&gt; outlines = (List&lt;Outline&gt;) feed.getOutlines();
        </pre></code>
